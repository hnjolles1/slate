# Introduction

Welcome to the CasperLabs project, implemented as a new permissionless, decentralized, public blockchain. Our open source Turing-complete smart contract platform is backed by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, and WebAssembly (wasm). Our particular consensus protocol in the CBC Casper family, backed by Vlad Zamfirâ€™s correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper work, is provably safe and live under partial synchrony without an in-protocol fault tolerance threshold.

Read our [Tech Spec](https://techspec.casperlabs.io/en/latest/) to Learn more about what we're building so you can become a contributor. 

### Who is this guide for

This documentation is intended for dApp Developers interested in creating **smart contracts**. You can use this documentation to learn about CasperLabs and how you can build applications with tools from our platform.

### Purpose of this guide

This document highlights the set of our core documentation prioritized for you to get started with our platform. This documentation is accessed here and located on our GitHub repository, the single source of truth for all Smart Contract Developer documentation.  The topics on the index include present and future documentation initiatives in our roadmap.

### Background

The motivation for this roadmap is inspired by feedback we are receiving from your recommendations. We hope you continue to provide your feedback as you embark on this journey with us -- we look forward to building a decentralized future together.
